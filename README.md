# Mine Count HUD
Creates a free HUD showing your current mine count. 

### Summary
The purpose of Mine Count HUD is to create a small HUD for tracking the number of mines you currently have in your inventory. This is something that you should put somewhere around your reticle for quick reference.

Historically, servers have provided players with 3 mines. Usually 3 mines is absolutely plenty. If you actually live long enough to use your 3 mines, you will most definitely pick up more from dead bodies.

However, servers have now started moving 1 mine for LT. 1 mine is much more difficult to track for the following reasons:
1. In the action of the game, you may forget whether or not you've already used your 1 mine or not.
2. When you walk over a dead body, it's not guaranteed that you'll pick up a mine. If you do, then you definitely want to know.

The T2 ammo bar takes up a lot of real estate on the screen, so people generally keep it at the bottom or top of the screen. With larger resolutions, you actually have to take your eyes off the game to see your mine count.

Having a smaller HUD next to your reticle means you can see your mine count immediately and act appropriately in that moment.
